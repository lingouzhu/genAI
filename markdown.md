## Outline View

The Outline view is a separate section in the bottom of the File Explorer. When expanded, it shows the symbol tree of the currently active editor. For Markdown files, the symbol tree is the Markdown file's header hierarchy.

## Preview Markdown

VS Code supports Markdown files out of the box. You just start writing Markdown text, save the file with the .md extension and then you can toggle the visualization of the editor between the code and the preview of the Markdown file; To switch between views, press Ctrl+Shift+V in the editor. You can view the preview side-by-side (Ctrl+K V) with the file you are editing and see changes reflected in real-time as you edit.
